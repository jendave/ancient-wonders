THE WONDROUS SIDE                                                        OF  THE  GALAXY
Ancient Wonders is a modular expansion for Ironsworn: Starforged
(hereafter referred to as Starforged), the science fiction tabletop
roleplaying game by Shawn Tomkin. Even though the use of
Starforged is encouraged, the majority of the content in this book is
system agnostic.
Throughout the supplement, you will be presented with a plethora of
random tables to enhance your experience in the science fiction game
of your preference. Ancient Wonders offers...
*  A realistic solar system generator for planetary and asteroid
   composition. This sub-system provides more richness in
   exploration and a more concisely focused narrative experience;
   you won't have adventures throughout multiple small sectors but
   rather in entire solar systems.
* Anexpansiveplanetgeneratorwithagreatvarietyofworldclasses
   and random tables to detail them, as well as oracles to create
   encounters on planetary surfaces and underwater.
*  Megastructures to discover, with a set of oracles and a sub-system
   for undertaking extensive expeditions in the alien, unfathomable
   depths of these marvels. These wonders come with default
   assumptions, truths, and unique mechanics for implementation in
   your campaign.
* Megacities to explore, with a set of oracles anda sub-system for
   researching the alien socieities that once inhabited them as well as
   default assumptions and truths for their inclusion in your campaign.
* Constructs, bio-mechanics, and anomaly generators for new
   types of encounters in alien and hazardous sites.
* Specialcompanionsasanewtypeofassetforthemostchallenging
   adventures. Made for Starforged.
* Items as a new type of assets to loot, find, and trade in the galaxy.
   Made for Starforged.
* Additional moves for making camp, entering into a hiatus

MARVELS OF FOREGONE AGES
Ancient Wonders is filled with countless marvels from times immemorial that you can find throughout your space adventures.
These wonders can be large or small, naturally formed or boldly engineered. Regardless of their shape or origin, the defining
characteristic of these findings is their ability to be awe-inspiring, even after an eternity.
SOLAR SYSTEMS
After galaxies and globular clusters, solar systems are the greatest ancient
wonders to be found in space. It is on these canvases, produced by millions
to billions of years of universal development, that all remaining marvels,
natural and artificial, can be found.
PLANETS
After stellar objects, planets are the largest celestial bodies in a solar
system. It is there that life and the infinite possibilities and complexities
of the cosmos unfold.
MEGASTRUCTURES
Megastructures are incredible constructions built by long-extinct alien
species. These feats of engineering are rare showcases of their civilizations'
capabilities and are where some of the products of their technology--and
the phenomena that derived from it--can be seen.
MEGACITIES
Megacities are the ruins of settlements that belonged to long-gone
civilizations. These places still hold many mysteries and continue to be
haunted by shadows of the past, though that doesn't stop humanity from
taking possession of them.
CONSTRUCTS
Constructs are synthetic beings. The ones designed by foregone species
are listed among the only yesteryear's marvels that are truly conscious of
their existence, and they protect the megastructures as zealous guardians.
BIO-MECHS
Bio-mechanics are products of ingenious engineering. They are the result
of artificial synthesis: a mixture of biological creature and construct; a
living being whose limbs and organs have been replaced by synthetic ones
or a synthetic being to which biological elements have been applied.
ANOMALIES
Anomalies are the residual phenomena of the experiments and advanced
technologies of the precursor civilizations. We know that these occurrences
constitute either a breakdown of the laws of reality or humanity's severe
lack of understanding of the true nature of the universe.
SPLINTERS
Splinters are items from eons ago that have survived the crushing passage
of time and have caused anomalies to emerge in the depths of alien sites.
The goal of many explorers of ancestral ruins, vaults, or megastructures is
to retrieve these priceless objects of power.

A GUIDE TO FINDING                                               SOLAR  SYSTEMS
Since the first stellar voyages, mankind has paved its way
through the cosmos by navigating to the light of distant
stars. The content present in this chapter is based on the
assumption that space travel is not accomplished by blindly
entering absolute darkness, but by letting stellar objects
guide our course; a course that leads us to encounter solar
systems made up of an infinite variety of compositions.
In Starforged, sectors are unmeasured areas with
undetermined sizes that may hold a variety of objects,
including stars, planets, and many other space sightings.
Expanding on that idea, the following subsystem further
solidifies what a sector is by redefining its area to that of a
solar system. Here, you will find a more structured approach
to sector creation and instructions on how to generate
plausible worlds. Planetary classes are determined by
proximity to a stellar object.
Finally, this system also includes two new maps, simple
and detailed, upon which to showcase and mark the many
celestial bodies that make up a solar system.
                                                                      ANCIENT WONDERS

               KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
               The following are the key concepts used in this chapter, their     corresponding term definitions, and how some aspects of the
               system interact with your game.

SECTOR SHEETS
Ancient Wonders comes with a playkit that includes two types of sector worksheets. Each offers a different level of abstraction to
illustrate a sector. Though you may choose to write down relevant information in plain text, these tools further detail your space.
SIMPLE SECTOR MAP
This map is the most abstract representation of a sector or solar system and is used if you do not wish to roll and determine which
section of an orbit any planet is in. As a result, the use of this map is simpler due to its smaller form factor.

DETAILED SECTOR MAP
This map is used when you wish to take into account the actual orbits of each planet around its star. Due to its larger size, this
version allows you to create a more visually realistic sector by allowing you to better represent elements of your narrative, such
as the distances between the celestial bodies. Given its scale, this map invites more overall exploration and discovery.
                                                                                                                   Planetary orbits

 FACTION INFLUENCE GRID
 Each sector sheet includes a table to manage the control
 factions have over the navigated area. To use it, slot factions
 into an appropriate field in the grid: Prominent, Expanded,
 Subsisting, Undermined, or Obscure.
 Leave blank fields for when you discover new factions or adjust
 their influence over time. When you have an encounter, such
 as a vessel, community, or territory in dispute, you may roll
 on the table to reveal the faction in control of it or the ones
 involved in the situation.

SOLAR SYSTEMS GENERATION
In this section, you have the steps to generate a solar system for your adventures. This generator includes instructions on
when to generate a megastructure if you are also using the content from Chapter 4, on page 84. To use this generator, you only
use the oracle dice (a pair of ten-sided as a percentile, commonly referred to as 1d100).
If you prefer not to go through this manual generation process, jump straight to the Quick Solar Systems section on page 24
to generate a prestructured solar system, as indicated in the following summary.
    1   If using Chapter 4: Megastructures, generate megastructures.
        Ask the Oracle (odds determined by your Megastructure Prevalence truth on page 87) if the solar system houses a
        megastructure. If the answer is "yes", roll >Megastructure on page 94 to reveal which one is present. Then, follow
                                the When Discovered guideline in the megastructure entry.
    2   Generate the stellar object.
        Roll >Stellar Object on the next page                        to  determine the  celestial body  whose gravitational force holds the other
                                objects in orbit.

    5   Finalize your solar system.
        Name your solar system to identify it. To do this, you can roll >Sector Name on page 33 of the Starforged Reference
        Guide. Then, mark any other information about the sector you have in advance.
        If this is your starting solar system, further define it by determining its region and detailing its settlements and
                                FTL passages.

STEP 1: GENERATE A MEGASTRUCTURE
If you are using the content from Chapter 4, Ask the Oracle if the solar system is home of any megastructure (odds determined by
your Megastructure Prevalence truth on page 87). If the answer is yes, roll >Megastructure Class on page 94 to determine which
one is present. Then, mark it in the solar system as per its When Discovered rule. This may determine the type of stellar object-
whether a star or black hole, the amount of planets, and the asteroid belts.
STEP 2: GENERATE THE STELLAR OBJECT
When you discover a solar system, use the table below in replacement of the one in Starforged.
Defining the stellar object is important when revealing the planetary classes of the worlds if you decide to use the Planetary
Heat guideline in this chapter.
STELLAR OBJECT
Use this table oracle to define the star at the center of the solar system.
Reroll the "Artificial star constructed by a long-dead civilization" result if your              precursors
Technological Scale truth on page 94 is that they were type 1 or 2.

d100 Stellar Object

1-5    Neutron star surrounded by intense magnetic fields
6-7    Unstable star showing signs of impending supernova
8-12   Two stars in close orbit connected by fiery tendrils of energy

STEP 3A: QUICKLY GENERATE THE
COMPOSITION OF A SOLAR SYSTEM
If you wish to skip the manual generation of planets and asteroid belts, roll >Quick Solar System on page 24
to predefine the number and locations of planets and asteroid belts in the solar system.
Chapter                         2:  Solar   Systems

STEP 3B: GENERATE PLANETS
Use the following oracles to reveal the amount of planets in a
solar system and their corresponding orbits.

PLANET LOCATION
Use this oracle to determine the placement of a planet around its stellar object. To use it...
* Calculate the number of orbits that are currently free--in which no planet or megastructure has been marked - and reference the corresponding column.
* Mark the planet in the resulting free planetary orbit. These are numbered as per their proximity to the stellar object - the 1st being the closest one.
* Shift one column to the right as the number of free planetary orbits changes and there are planets left to place.

STEP 5: FINALIZE YOUR SOLAR SYSTEM

As all major celestial bodies have now been marked, it is important to finalize your solar system by taking the following steps.
** Roll >SectorName on page 33 of the StarforgedReferenceGuideto give your solar system a name.
** Ifyouhaveuncoveredinformationaboutthesolarsysteminadvanceofyourarrivalthathasnotalreadybeenmarked-suchasthe
   planets' details or the faction in control-do so now.

YOUR STARTING SOLAR SYSTEM
If this is your starting solar system, do the following to add the
necessary details to the area of space that will be the backdrop
of your adventures.
If you are playing in a free-form way, don't get stuck on the
details. You can omit this process and add the background as
you go during play.
To find more narrative guidelines for this process, see page 114
of the Starforged rulebook.
DETERMINE YOUR STARTING REGION
Choose the region in which you start your campaign. This will
mostly determine the tone of your game.
Terminus: Humanity's most inhabited area of space. This is
the safest and most civilized region of the known galaxy. Start
here if your quests will be bound to interacting with people
and societies.
Outlands: Humanity's area of expansion. Communities here
are scarce, and they battle to make safe homes in yet-to-be
conquered territories. Start here if your adventures will be
characterized by interactions in spaces poorly controlled by
powerful entities.
Expanse: Humanity's least known area. Full of dangers and
threatening perils. Only the bravest colonizers have ventured
this far. Start here if you envision yourself being one of the
few who charges alone into the darkness of space.
GENERATE SETTLEMENTS
First, determine the amount of settlements of the solar system
as per the chosen region.
*  Terminus: 4 settlements
*  Outlands: 3 settlements

*  Expanse: 2 settlements
Then, for each settlement in your starting solar system, you
may generate the communities with the Settlements oracles
on page 54 of the Starforged Reference Guide or page 186 of
Sundered Isles. However, do not add too many details unless
you previously decided that one of these communities is going
to be the location in which your campaign starts.
** If there are no planets in the solar system, all settlement
   locations are in deep space. Place them where you see fit
   or use the Coordinates oracle on page 19.
** If the settlement location is planetside or orbital, use the
   following table to determine on which world it can be found.

Planet Proximity

Each column of the table below corresponds to the number of
planets in the solar system. On the other side, the result is the
proximity of the planet to the stellar object, not the orbit in
which they reside. A planet in the 1st proximity is the one in the
nearest orbit to the stellar object, whereas the planet in the
2nd or higher proximity is the one in a farther orbit.

41-75     4th
76-90     5th
91-100    6th

ADD SETTLEMENTS DETAILS
If your campaign starts in a settlement, choose the one that
you find the most interesting and add any relevant details, such
as the size, atmosphere and surface features of the planet on
which the settlement resides (page 40), and other aspects of
the community (Starforged Reference Guide on page 54 or
Sundered Isles on page 186).
Alternatively, you can introduce a sector problem or conflict to
start off your campaign. To do this, use the table on page 126
of the Starforged rulebook.
CREATE PASSAGES
Set the passages for this solar system. A passage is a charted
course in a large network of FTL paths. Travelers rely on these
routes for traversing through space. Mechanically, using a
passage allows you to resolve the outcome of an expedition
without taking much risk. To learn more about passages, see
pages 68 and 120 of the Starforged rulebook.
Set the number of passages in your starting solar system in
accordance with the region where it resides.
*  Terminus: 3 passages

*  Outlands: 2 passages
*  Expanse: 1 passage
Then, mark the passages by drawing them as lines on
your sector sheet. Each passage must either connect two
settlements or connect a settlement to the edge of the solar
system, connecting it to another.

PLANETARY HEAT
Space is a cold and lonely place. However, the stars are oases of warmth, energy, and potential life. The following guidelines make
use of the selection you have made for your system's stellar object. With them, you will determine the planetary class around it.
When marking planets in a solar system, do not reveal their characteristics unless you travel there or are provided with data prior to
the expedition. For this, instead of using the Planetary Class oracle, you may use the following rules to determine the type of planet.
STELLAR OBJECT HEAT MAP
Consult this table to determine the temperature level of a planetary orbit. Use your result from the Stellar Object oracle on
page 21.
A heat map consists of six segments representing the six planetary orbits. The leftmost segment is the closest planetary orbit to
the stellar object, with the rightmost segment being the furthest.
Each segment is one of six Heat Levels. These Heat Levels not only provide a descriptor to the orbits but also determine which
column to reference on the Planetary Class Based on Heat oracle.

EXPLORING PLANETS
When you undertake expeditions on a world, use the following guidelines
to dress the locations and inject uncertainty, danger, strangeness, or
narrative potential into your story.
The Planetside Waypoint oracle below provides moment-to-moment
details whereas the Planetside Peril and Planetside Opportunity oracles on
the next pages provide inspiration for conflicts or beneficial encounters
or events.

page 142 of that supplement.
* Sundered Isles for caverns or tunnel network exploration with the
Cave Oracles on page 226 of that supplement. The Living World, from
this chapter, offers its own set of underground exploration oracles.
* Starforged Reference Guide for dread aspects with the Chaotic
location theme oracles, on page 102 of that material, if you are using
the cursed die as explained in Chapter 1, page 11.

DEPTH LEVELS
When exploring any sizable body of water, there are two major factors to consider: light's ability to penetrate through water and
your proximity to land. Both may vastly influence your experience and envisioning of these aquatic locales during your quests.
The following key terms and the illustration on the next page provide more information regarding the structure of an ocean or
sea and light's influence on it.
The deeper the level of exploration underwater, the greater the environmental pressure. While it may be possible to descend
and explore great depths without a vessel capable of traveling underwater, it is always safer to do so.
ZONES
* Opensea: Vast expanse of water far from land
* Continental shelf: Gently sloping terrain that gradually          descends ever d    eeper
* Continentalslopeandrise: Steep transition between the             continental shelf  and abyssal  plain

LIGHT ZONES

* Twilight: Dimly lit region characterized by fading light
* Abyssal: Deep region of high pressure and total darkness

ZONE ENCOUNTER RANKS
As you descend into the unfathomable darkness of the sea, the environment gets more oppressive and dangerous; the peril and
urgency increase. Deeper underwater zones offer riskier encounters.
When you transition down into a new zone once or twice, increase the rank of the encounters in that zone (to a maximum of epic).
Alternatively, you can use the following guidelines.
ENCOUNTER RANKS PER UNDERWATER                                    ZONE
*  Open ocean: Expedition rank
*  Continental shelf: Expedition rank

*  Abyssal plain: Expedition rank +1

MOONS SIZE SPECIFICATION
Use this table if you want to numerically specify the size of a moon. Roll its host
planet's circumference and divide the result by the appropriate amount as per
the corresponding moon size.
You may treat any moon smaller than 2,000 km as an asteroid. If you do, do
not roll its Planetary Class. To flavor your exploration of these environments
you may use the Large Rogue Asteroid features present in the Space Sightings
Expanded supplement by Ludic Pen.

CRYSTAL TYPE
Use the table below to generate crystals. Roll once to determine which crystal rarity column to reference. Then, roll again to
uncover the crystal type result. The exotic table provides descriptors for incredibly rare minerals; roll up to twice when referencing
said column.
If you are using the Space Sightings Expanded supplement by Ludic Pen, you can roll on these tables to generate the minerals of
Debris Fields if they are made of crystals.

LURKING THREAT
The interior of a living world is horribly inhospitable; you are the foreign organism that must be exterminated. To represent this
growing danger, add a tension clock. When you suffer a cost through failure, delay, or inaction, you may advance the clock to show
the threat drawing closer. This table offers inspiration for these scenarios, including what signs you encounter as the tension
clock advances, and what occurs when the clock fills.
To learn more about tension clocks, see page 238 of the Starforged rulebook.

ATMOSPHERE, LIFE, AND SETTLEMENTS
Roll >Atmosphere, >Life, and >Settlements    for         the
planetary class of the central band.
TIDALLY-LOCKED MOON
When a moon is tidally-locked, it is orientated towards the
planet it orbits, as opposed to the stellar object. As such,
it will have only one planetary class instead of different
bands. Roll on the >Planetary Class table on page 41 to
determine the world type of the moon.
TRANSITIONING TO ANOTHER BAND
While undertaking an expedition in a tidally-locked world,
you may interpret the "Enter a new biome" Surface Feature
oracle result as a transition to the environment of the next
planetary class. If unsure, Ask the Oracle.

BANDS
Use this table to reveal the planetary classes of each lateral band of a tidally-locked world. First, roll to determine the light side
planetary class, then; roll on that column to define the dark side planetary class.

CENTRAL BAND
On the Dark Side column of the Bands oracle, tally the number of worlds between the planetary classes rolled for the light and dark
sides of the planet. Then, use that amount to determine which column to reference on the following table to define the planetary
class of the central band. If there is only one world in between, envision it as the planetary class of the central band.

ARCHITECTURAL MARVELS
All civilizations have needs that must be met to ensure their continued survival and longevity--residential, scientific, industrial,
and many others. Megastructures are one way these requirements could be satisfied in the most extreme possible sense.
Megastructures are large, artificial constructs, either consisting of a singular structure or many parts working in tandem with one
another to achieve their purpose. They can take any number of forms; from vast towers or enormous rings to star-encapsulating
spheres or disks. These ancient wonders are the darkest and most dangerous places for exploration in the entire galaxy. They are
endless sources of adventures and narrative tension. Below are guidelines for implementing them in your sessions.
MEGASTRUCTURES IN YOUR CAMPAIGN
In this exercise, you will learn the characteristics of megastructures to establish the foundation for their addition to your campaign.
The Default Assumptions establish a baseline by defining key traits of these marvels, whereas the Truths are a set of options to
make them fit your vision.

YOUR TRUTHS
The following are your truths regarding key aspects of the megastructures: their size and rarity.
Choose a truth from the three options below or roll. If you are playing with others, give everyone at the table an opportunity to
influence each one of these choices.
Don't get bogged down in defining the details behind each truth. Use them as guidelines to inspire and surprise you as you play.
You may also skip this exercise and not define the truths upfront, choosing to define them only when it becomes necessary or
relevant during play.

    LAUNCH LOOP
    A launch loop is an artificial, ring-shaped structure situated around a world, just above its atmosphere. This
    gigatransporter can extend partway or fully around a planet or greater megastructure and is supported by colossal
    tethers. The interior ring of these marvels contains the vessel that travels along the rail from station to station
    or into space. Above or below the surface of a launch loop, there may be habitable structures that contains cloud
    cities or ceiling cities.
    MASS CATAPULT
    A mass catapult consist of a vacuum tube that goes from the launch station to the exit. The tram launches the
    vessel--such as a spacecraft--into orbit at enormous speed, like a giant blow dart. Smaller versions of a mass
    catapult might have been used as weapons to hurl great projectiles at orbiting spacecrafts.

SKYHOOK
A skyhook is a cable attached to an orbiting station that hangs towards the surface of a planet or greater
megastructure. Payloads are brought to the end of the hook by a suborbital launch vehicle that then passes the
vessel to the hook before descending back to the world's surface. Then, the station rotates around its center of
mass to fling the payload into deep space.
SPACE ELEVATOR
A space elevator consists of a colossal tether that extends from a planet or megastructure's surface that is
attached to a counterweight such as a station or an asteroid. The vessel, called a climber, travels from the ground
station to the orbital station and back again, delivering the cargo or passengers into orbit or to the world's surface.

MEGASTRUCTURE STATUS
Use this oracle to identify the current condition of a megastructure. Some of these marvels are made up of many individual
structures. In those cases, you may roll on this table to determine the status of any individual assemblies instead of the whole
megastructure. Additionally, you may Ask the Oracle to determine whether the megastructure or assembly is visibly damaged. If
yes, you may interpret the status result as a consequence of the damage.

DELVING INTO A MEGASTRUCTURE
When undertaking an expedition into the depths of a megastructure, first determine if you are actually delving into its interior. The
rule of thumb is to differentiate a habitable surface from an interior or surface not meant to be habitable. Some of these ancient
wonders have a habitable-or formerly inhabited-surface, such as ringworlds, ecumenopolis, or celestial disks. Others don't have
habitable surfaces, such as Dyson spheres or celestial brains.
When you make an expedition on the habitable surface of a megastructure, treat the exploration of the environments as stated
in its corresponding section. When you delve into the interior of any megastructure or a surface not meant to be habitable, use
the guidelines presented here.

LEVEL RANKS
As you delve deeper into a megastructure, the site gets more repressive and hazardous. The level ranks represent how
the environment becomes more difficult to traverse.
The rank of each level of the expedition depends on the megastructure scale. When you enter a new level of the
construction, check the table below to determine at which pace to mark progress on the minor progress track.

Delving into the unknown depths of megastructures is not for the faint of heart or low of means. Tales abound of those who
ventured in alone, unprepared, or inexperienced, and never returned. The ones who insist on making these perilous expeditions
are warned to go in with strong gear, ample supplies, and the company of strong allies or companions.
Chapter 7: Special Companion Assets (page 198) and Chapter 8: Item Assets (page 208) offer new types of cards for Starforged
that make delving into megastructures a more feasible endeavor. Additionally, Chapter 9: Additional Moves (page 222) offers a set
of mechanics for Starforged that allow you to recover in the midst of an expedition and learn from your misses in the long-term.

MEGASTRUCTURE
We like to believe that the known megastructures have been studied enough to assign them a category, but there are many others
that remain shrouded in mystery.
Since these alien wonders pose a great risk not only to explorers, but to all human communities inhabiting their sector, the first
reconnaissance expedition must be undertaken with great caution and preparation. Discovering the purpose of a megastructure
means potentially gaining greater knowledge of the precursor civilizations and understanding why present-day factions might
fight to gain control of this alien power.
The individuals chosen to undertake the initial expeditions into an unknown megastructure will always be met with intense scrutiny
and some level of trepidation--a symptom of a bigger question: how far is humanity willing to go to discover the unknown?

MEGASTRUCTURE PURPOSE
Megastructures are massive alien vaults built to fulfill
a particular function. Coming to a definitive conclusion
about their purpose requires undertaking an arduous,
intense expedition.
When you explore an unidentified megastructure, you
may use this oracle to reveal the megastructure function
at an appropriate point in your survey, either due to the
completion of your expedition or a because your narrative
framing would naturally lead you to a revelation regarding
the nature of the site.

                                 Rumors extolling the discovery of a new type of megastructure
                                 have begun to circulate. A >Guild (RG, pg 73), warning that its
                                 sector is believed to be infested with a >Creature (RG, pg 68),
                                 commissioned delvers to locate the site, learn its purpose,
                                 and return with this knowledge. While many have accepted
                                 the task, only the first to return will be rewarded. Why does
                                 this guild have an interest in this information? How will you
                                 ensure you are the first delver to return?

                                 Then, follow the guideline as per the result. If the
                                 megastructure is in...
                                 * Deep space: Roll >Coordinates (pg 19) to determine

Asteroid processors appear to have been built to help fulfill the intense
resource demands of the precursor's civilization. These structures
navigate through asteroid belts and fields, identifying and targeting the
most resource-rich bodies before undocking a fleet of smaller harvesting
platforms. These then extract and return the identified resources before
turning them into usable materials.
Venturing near an asteroid processor may carry a significant risk. Tales
circulate of explorers who strayed too close and were harvested by
the structure. If these stories hold any truth, it is speculated that the
processor analyzed the approaching ship and identified it as a reservoir
of valuable resources. Whether this categorization would be intentional or
due to a malfunction remains a mystery.
ASTEROID FIELD TYPE
Use this oracle to determine the composition of the asteroid field from
which the processor is collecting resources.
1--50     Mineral asteroids

You may use the Space Sightings Expanded supplement, published by
Ludic Pen, to further generate details for these asteroid fields.
HARVESTING PLATFORMS
Use this table to determine the quantity and size of platforms that the
asteroid processor undocks and is composed of. Maintain this result for
any other harvester platform encountered in the same solar system or

HARVESTING METHODS
While many processors and platforms are equipped with a diverse array of
tools-such as fleets of mining constructs, potent lasers, and gravitational
beams-others employ less refined methods. These methodically tear,
blow apart, or engulf entire asteroids. Though the process may vary from
one structure to another, the results are equally effective.

       A technologically advanced civilization's need for various gases is often under-
       appreciated or misunderstood, with little thought being given to the aspects of
       a society that would not be possible without an ample and varied supply of these
       elements. While humanity's requirements for various gases can usually be renewably
       harvested from the worlds on which we settle, the needs of the precursors
       undoubtedly exceeded the reservoirs of their homeworlds.
       While we can only speculate about the precursors' specific uses of any particular
       gas, we believe these enormous harvesters were how they obtained various gases en
       masse. These megastructures hover among the clouds of gas giants, siphoning gases
       at an incredible pace. Given enough time, it is believed they may deplete a world of
       its entire atmosphere.

MEGASTRUCTURE                                                         Type 3 megastructures

Since the earliest days of our astronomical research, we have
been captivated by the unbelievable forces of black holes and the
dangers they entail. Even today, the gravitational pull of a black
hole can ward away even the most hardened pilots, while the
unique properties of the singularity at its heart continue to defy
our understanding.
The discovery of the first black hole containers shocked the
scientific community. Through these megastructures, we have
come to recognize that the precursors' knowledge of physics
was so great that they were capable of not only harnessing the
destructive potential of a black hole, but also creating one.
POWERING
The presence of a black hole container implies the powering of at
least one other megastructure in the sector. To determine which
one it is, roll >Megastructure Class on page 95 referencing the
type 2 column.
KUGELBLITZ SILO
The problem of how to reliably store energy for long-term use
continues to plague us, even following the advent of the modern
power cell. Through our research into kugelblitz silos, we have come
to believe that they act as a battery in the most unconventional
and extreme sense.
While we can only guess at the exact processes involved in their
creation, by analyzing the black hole located at the megastructure's
center we can theorize that they were formed not by matter-as is
the case with naturally occurring black holes-but by pure energy.
This would have the effect of allowing a near-infinite amount of
power to be stored within its event horizon while also minimizing
self-discharge.
The megastructure's perimeter towers seem to serve simpler,
albeit critical functions. We believe that while acting to contain
the central black hole, they also provide the means to deposit or
extract energy from it.
ANOMALY
For unknown reasons, storing energy in a kugelblitz silo for gradual
use causes anomalous effects in the surrounding environment.
Use the following table to determine which effect is manifested.
1-20    Destructive gravitational waves
21-50   Electromagnetic pulses

                                                        PENROSE SPHERE
                                                        It took the discovery of the first Penrose sphere for us to understand
                                                        that the precursors had built megastructures capable of supplying
                                                        their civilizations with enough energy to outlive the eventual
                                                        deaths of all stars. The only major caveat is that the Penrose
                                                        sphere is simultaneously the largest bomb ever conceived. The
                                                        detonation of one would destroy anything within a solar system.
                                                        Given their destructive potential, none have dared to delve
                                                        into a Penrose sphere. Relying on observation and our current
                                                        understanding of physics, it is assumed that the interior is
                                                        that of a perfect mirror. By using electromagnetic waves, the
                                                        megastructure may utilize the extreme rotational speed of its
                                                        black hole to scatter the energy and amplify its power before

                                                        It is believed that if the mechanisms used to harvest the energy are
                                                        deactivated or cease to function, the energy buildup would destroy

Humanity has long dreamed of becoming masters of the stars. For most, those words refer to a calling, a desire to explore the
galaxy to see all of its sights and understand all of its mysteries. For the precursors, however, their immense technological
capabilities and understanding of physical laws allowed them to build megastructures to achieve that dream in the literal sense.
Celestial harvesters are structures capable of harvesting stellar objects for their materials and energy. There are two types: star
lifters--which harvest stars--and accretion macrocollectors--which gather energy and resources from black holes.
STAR LIFTER
The knowledge of how to extract minerals and ores has been
utilized by humanity for untold generations. In many cases,
the precursors used similar--if more advanced--methods
to obtain raw resources for use by their civilizations. While
many of these practices may have still been used up to
the time of the precursors' disappearance, we believe star
lifters were likely the pinnacle of their mining technology.
Through the deployment of little-understood mechanisms,
these structures appear capable of bypassing or burrowing
through a star's outer layers. They then proceed to separate
and draw out the various materials created by the fusion of
its atoms and tear the star apart for its resources over the
course of thousands--if not millions--of years.
STELLAR HAZARD
Witnessing a functioning star lifter leaves no mystery
regarding the dangers these megastructures are capable
of posing to their surroundings. The process of harvesting
material directly from a star's core is catastrophically
violent and generates hazards ranging from enormous
solar flares to storms of ionizing particles.
When you are in a sector containing an operational--or
dysfunctional--star lifter, set a ten-segment tension
clock. Once all segments are filled, the star lifter has drawn
away enough of the star's mass that it creates a temporary,
system-spanning hazard. Use the table below to identify it.

Many examples of the precursors' destructive potential
exist within the galaxy, but few could conceive of the
power of celestial weapons. Less knowledgeable explorers
may initially mistake these megastructures for unusual or
bizarre ringworlds, though their true nature becomes clear
when considering their composition and energy emissions.
They are weapons built to lay waste to entire planets or
solar systems with a single shot.
Celestial weapons are gargantuan networks of rings bathed
in heat and light that closely encircle their host star. There
are two types of celestial weapons: Nicoll-dyson arrays--
which are made of independent Dyson rings--and helio-
obliterators--whose rings form an incomplete sphere.
It is generally understood that deploying one of these
weapons against fellow human beings would constitute
the gravest crime ever committed. These structures
have inspired such awe and terror in all who witness them
that it's horrifying to consider what sort of enemy would
necessitate their construction.

Altering a planet's core is usually a process millennia in the making.
The precursors were able to do this without that much time using core
manipulators. There are two types: ferrothermal engines-which are capable
of warming a planet's core-and geothermal stabilizers-which balance a
world's core and preserve its stability.
FERROTHERMAL ENGINE
Without a molten core, a world's magnetic field will either never form or begin
to dissipate, allowing solar winds and radiation to bombard the surface and
eventually strip away any atmosphere and hydrosphere until all that remains
is a desolate rock. Ferrothermal engines allowed the precursors to reignite
the hearts of dying worlds, prevent catastrophes, or create environments
conducive to life.

Dyson Objects were constructed in order to seize the
energy of their host star. These marvels of engineering
speak volumes of the precursors' requirement for power
and their ambition to expand across the galaxy.
DYSON OBJECT VARIANT
Use this table to determine the type of the Dyson object.
1-50    Dyson swarm
51-80   Dyson ring
81-100  Dyson shell
DYSON SWARM
A fleet of hundreds of thousands, if not millions,             of
individual solar collectors encapsulating their host star.
DYSON RING
A single ring or series of rings that encircle the host star
and slowly rotate while collecting energy. Their enormous
size and rotation can cause worlds outside their reach to
experience frequent, prolonged eclipses
DYSON SHELL
An almost all-encompassing barrier constructed to
encompass an entire star and absorb its entire energy
output. These gargantuan constructions dim the light of the
star significantly as they absorb the majority of its energy.
POWERING
The presence of a Dyson object implies the powering of
at least one other megastructure in the solar system or
sector. To determine which one is it, roll >Megastructure

       These vast structures play a crucial role in transforming planetary atmospheres
       and biospheres. They function as both absorbers and emitters of various gases and
       biomolecules. The absorption process involves the intake of specific gases, possibly
       harmful or unnecessary for the intended life forms. Simultaneously, these structures
       vent out a cocktail of biomolecules and gases essential for fostering life, dramatically
       altering atmospheric conditions. This dual functionality allows for the creation of a

Explorers who have ventured inside these megastructures speak of traveling several miles through an artificial shell to eventually
find a vast, naturalesque environment in its interior. The artificial landscape, teeming with flora and fauna, is not unlike a menagerie
that the megastructure's keepers tend to and care for. It has been theorized that the megastructure's original purpose may have
been to function as a research facility where life in all its forms and varieties could be studied in detail.
EXPLORING AN ECOSPHERE
The shell of an ecosphere is composed of many platforms and portals. You may explore these facilities using the Delving Into a
Megastructure section of this chapter on page 98. But if you choose not to explore, and instead search for a way down to the environment
within the megastructure, treat this expedition to reach a space elevator (page 93) as one of rank troublesome or dangerous.

Also known as shellworlds, eucumenopoleis is a megacity that grew to encompass the majority or entirety of their planetary body,
covering their surface with a vast array of networked structures built across many segmented layers.
Given their scale, ecumenopoleis were presumably home to billions, potentially trillions, of inhabitants living between their layers.
Due to their immense population, these worlds almost certainly relied on an interplanetary network of resources to sustain them.
It stands to reason that when the end of the precursors finally came, all life forms on the planet died with them. However, the old
saying has proven true time and time again: life finds a way.
EXPLORING AN ECUMENOPOLIS
When you explore the surface of an ecumenopolis, you may treat it like any other world, generating the appropriate details with
only the oracles present in this section. However, given that an ecumenopoleis is actually a massive megacity, you may use the
content from Chapter 5 on page 168, which offers guidelines and oracles for exploring precursor settlements, learning about their
species, and the threats you might encounter in these places.

GIGAFOUNDRIES                                                      Rings that encircle stellar objects and process raw materials.
Ever since the advent of the industrial revolution, mankind have been automating manufacturing with varying degrees of success.
While many look at our most sophisticated factories and believe we have achieved all our species laid out for ourselves, we need
only glimpse the gigafoundries left by the precursors to realize that our industrial revolution is still in its infancy.
There are two types of gigafoundries: stellar hyperforges-which encircle entire stars, and system-forges-which consist of
numerous rings around a stellar object to cover the whole system.

Named for the ancient art form of using lacquer and precious metals to repair broken pottery, this planet has similarly been
painstakingly reassembled. Its broken crust is stitched together by vast structures and bands of glistening material.
When many explorers sought to delve into the bands that bind this world together, they found themselves unable to part with the
alien exhibit on its surface. The environment has been repurposed to host the art and monuments of a now-extinct civilization. It
is a planet where all of its aspects--land, sea, and life--have been transformed to serve as a grand stage on which the precursors
once showcased their culture.
EXPLORING A KINTSUGI WORLD
The environments, features, and lifeforms of a kintsugi world were reshaped and manipulated to turn the planet into a vast gallery.
When beginning to explore the surface of a kintsugi world, you may Ask the Oracle if its environment, features, and lifeforms
appear in a way that is reminiscent of any human art style. If yes, you may either envision the style or roll on the oracle below to
determine their aesthetic.

Encased within a transparent shell and encircled by vast solar arrays and reflectors,
a dense atmosphere obfuscates the shrouded world. The planet is presumed to
have once been a Jovian world that was terraformed as part of an agricultural
project to feed the incalculably large population of the precursor civilizations.
Now, the Nezzarine garden is an untamed wilderness; a realm of strange and
dangerous lifeforms thriving amidst thick fog. Few delvers have ventured
below the clouds and returned alive, and those who have were overwhelmed
by awe and terror, describing a landscape dominated by towering megaflora
and encounters with gargantuan megafauna roaming the land, waters, and
sky. This is a world where nature reigns supreme, and where humans are
unwelcome intruders.
EXPLORING A NEZZARINE GARDEN
The shell of a Nezzarine garden is composed of many platforms and portals. You
may explore these facilities using the Delving Into a Megastructure section of
this chapter on page 98. But if you choose not to explore, and instead search
to find a way down to the surface of the planet, treat the expedition to reach
a space elevator as rank troublesome or dangerous (page 93).
Once inside the encapsulated world, if you are exploring...
*    The atmosphere of the planet: Treat it as a Jovian world (page 58).
*    The surface of the planet: Treat it as a jungle world (mono biome: megaflora
     with the additional, perpetual feature of being in an all-encompassing fog;
     page 60).
Use the following tables to determine the atmosphere and the presence of life.

Every civilization needs great constructions to offer protection. In
mankind's exploration of the galaxy, we have discovered that the
measures taken by the precursors to defend their worlds match their
civilization's ambition.
The precursors had two types of planetary defenses: the defense
nexus--composed of numerous counter-offensive emplacements
around a world, and the aegisphere--a set of force fields that cover it.

Seldom sighted, many planetcraft resemble the familiar
silhouette of humanity's spacecrafts. Their function is
unmistakable. However, nothing may be more terrifying
than a human colony discovering that their homeworld--a
planet believed to be just like any other--is, in fact, an alien
starship. The truth dawns as the megastructure reawakens
and begins its journey into the void, the neighboring planets
that the settlement once knew vanish into the distance,
and the comforting light of their home star fades into the
encroaching darkness of interstellar space.

Little evidence remains of what the surface of these
worlds originally was like. It appears they were deemed to
have only one suitable fate: consumption.
The resource requirements of any large civilization would
eventually outstrip the ability of its homeworlds to supply
itself. The logical conclusion is that worlds particularly rich
in raw resources would be broken down and processed
wholly to fuel the precursors' ever-growing needs.

Ringworlds are circular, artificial habitats ranging in size from orbital stations to circling entire stars. There are three versions of
Ringworlds, each one larger than the next: Stanford torus, which are considered to be colossal settlements; Bishop Rings, which
are planet-sized; and stellar ringworlds, which are large enough to sorround a stellar object.

This megastructure consists of many individual constructions built upon and within an asteroid belt. They function as automated
defense mechanisms, unceremoniously opening fire on anyone who would dare cross their borders. The weapons technology used
in the emplacements is sometimes mysterious and esoteric, which serves as an example to argue that the scientific vanguard of
the precursors consisted in developing weapons of war to protect their most precious assets.
While many have attempted the perilous journey beyond their borders, few, if any, have succeeded. Those who witness these
encounters are left with a couple of question: How do we break through?
PRECURSOR TERRITORY
While much of the galaxy contains the remains of the
precursors' achievements, solar systems where we have
detected the presence of a sentinel belt seem to harbor a
greater prevalence of precursor constructions, indicating
these were areas of particular importance to their
civilizations. These regions could have fulfilled a variety of
functions, from serving as administrative centers to being
ancestral homeworlds. Given the implied value of these
areas, it stands to reason that they would have become
focal points for their species.
DEFENSIVE EMPLACEMENTS
Use this oracle to identify the number and size of the
platforms in a sentinel belt. This result--alongside that
of the Megastructure Status oracle (page 96)--serve as
guides for the likelihood of encountering weapons within
the belt as well as the rank of an encounter.
To determine the size of the emplacements, you may either
roll once to signify the same size of all of them or roll once
per encounter.

has made any attempt to establish settlements incredibly
difficult. No human settlements can be found there.

Given the scale of the precursor civilizations, it is undeniable that they required vast numbers of space-faring ships and constructs
to facilitate their needs. Automated and capable of producing an incredible number of units simultaneously, we believe these
ring-like megastructures were the solution to that issue. These are three types of shipyards: equatorial shipyards, which encircle
worlds; hyperstructural shipyards, which encircle stars; and behemoth assemblers, which are smaller than the other two, but
designed to produce the largest units.

Throughout mankind's voyages through the galaxy, it has been discovered that the precursors mastered astraforming--the process
of manipulating and altering the behavior of the stars. This was accomplished through stellar manipulators, megastructures that
were built in two variants: fusion suppressors, which cool stars; and stellar compressors, which heat them.
Through the use of gravity and little-understood technologies, these megastructures can bring about significant changes within
a stellar object; particularly, the rate of its fusion reactions. There are many theorized reasons for this, and it is understood that
the act of manipulating a star will in turn alter the environments of any orbiting worlds.
FUSION SUPPRESSOR
Fusion suppressors emit pulses of an unknown energy that, upon collision
with their host star, dim its brightness and still its surface. The pulses
calm the furnace at the heart of the star, slowing the rate of its fusion
reactions. This relaxed rate of fusion causes the star to release less energy
than would be naturally possible, drastically increasing its life span while
significantly cooling the orbiting worlds.
As a result of the fusion suppressor's effects, the temperatures
experienced by orbiting the worlds are decreased. When determining their
class, do either of the following:
HEAT MAP MODIFIER (SOLAR SYSTEM BASED)
When you consult the Stellar Object Heat Map table on page 26 to define
the type of worlds orbiting a fusion suppressor, decrease by one the
temperature level of the planetary orbits (to a minimum of "Frigid").
PLANETARY CLASS (SECTOR BASED)
Use this table to define the type of worlds orbiting a fusion suppressor.

                                                  STELLAR COMPRESSOR
                                                  Stellar compressors exert such gravitational force upon their host star that
                                                  they squeeze the celestial body's constituent gases. By doing so, stellar
                                                  compressors excite the atoms which merge faster and with greater ferocity,
                                                  increasing the rate of nuclear fusion. This quickened rate of fusion causes
                                                  the star to release more energy than would naturally be possible, which
                                                  drastically reduces its life span while significantly heating the orbiting worlds.
                                                  As a result of the stellar compressor's effects, the orbiting worlds
                                                  experiences increased temperatures. When determining worlds' classes,
                                                  do the following.

The precursors built many megastructures to alter planetary environments through a variety of means: restarting a planet's core,
manipulating a world's atmosphere, or heating its surface by redirecting sunlight. However, none other than the terraformer hub
can subjugate every aspect of a planet so completely.
This enormous floating dome roams the surface of the planet, altering its nature. Although its mechanisms cannot be completely
understood, delvers who reach these enormous complexes report that through a combination of the megastructure's apparatuses
and legions of keepers, these facilities can alter any aspects of a planet to the point of creating an entire different world.

       Delvers that have discovered an operational terravore have described it as an enormous inverted pyramid that bristles with energy
       and floats above a molten planet in a geostationary orbit. They report that the energy periodically dissipates to erupt as a beam
       which tears and superheats the world below.
       It is believed that the megastructure functions as an extraordinarily advanced piece of mining equipment. Its beam pierces
       through a planet's surface and deep into its mantle or core, performing the role of both a drill and resource collector on an
       enormous scale while rapidly melting the world's crust in the process.
       Of course, it has been theorized that this megastructure may be used as a weapon. Not only to directly eradicate settlements on
       the world that hosts it but to destroy the ecosystems from which they subsist.

While space travel is a feat humanity can easily accomplish, the cost
is time; time taken to recharge or refuel our drives at an anchorage, as
well as the time that passes over the course of any journey. Warp gates
are how we believe the precursors were able to avoid or mitigate this
cost while also facilitating their logistical networks.
TRAVELING THROUGH A WARP GATE
While the mechanisms of a warp gate are unknown or jealously guarded
by those privy to their secrets, it is believed that with the appropriate
knowledge, they can be used to travel instantly across vast distances.
REQUIREMENTS
To activate and travel through a warp gate, three requirements must
be met:
*    The warp gate you wish to travel through must be operational or
     dysfunctional. While the status of any individual megastructure
     will undoubtedly vary, in order to use them for travel, they must be
     functional to some degree.
*    You must have the appropriate knowledge to activate the
     warp gate. While there may be individuals willing to share this
     knowledge, the costs associated would be too great for most to
     bear. Instead, those brave enough may delve into a warp gate
     and, through exploration and study, learn the secret to utilizing
     these wonders.
*    You must know the location of another online warp gate to
     serve as your destination. These megastructures seemingly were
     designed to function as a vast network, where a vessel may enter
     one and emerge from another. While the precursors may have been
     able to freely travel between any warp gates in the galaxy, the fact
     remains that we are unable to use them without first knowing the
     location of another one to serve as our destination.
CONSIDERATIONS
When all requirements are met, you may choose to activate and travel
through the warp gate network with the following considerations:
*    Operational: If both megastructures are operational and you
     use them, you travel successfully with no narrative cost at your
     destination. If you are using the Starforged system, you may take
     an automatic strong hit when you Set a Course through the warp
     gate network to your destination.
*    Dysfunctional: If one or both megastructures are dysfunctional
     and you use them, you travel successfully but face a cost at your
     destination. If you are using the Starforged system, you may take
     an automatic weak hit when you Set a Course through the warp
     gate network to your destination.

Megacities are ancient places that were once the settlements of alien civilizations. These vast sites harness incomprehensible
technology and vary in their location, size, complexity, and even the material from which they are primarily made. These wonders
are a rich source of lore, adventure, and narrative potential. Below are the guidelines for implementing them in your sessions.

MEGACITIES IN YOUR ADVENTURES
These marvels of forgotten ages might be used in your game sessions in many respects. Venturing into settlements originally
inhabited by extinct alien societies offers a broad enough framework for countless premises. Powerful factions often sponsor
expeditions to megacities in the hopes of obtaining significant precursor assets, but not all explorers are sent by patrons. Some
go of their own accord. For what purpose?
Here are some reasons why explorers might interact with megacities in your campaign.

EXPLORING A MEGACITY
Even if humans inhabit a megacity, many districts, streets, roads, and corners remain unexplored. Conquering one of these sites
is, in fact, a task that takes more than simply settling in one of its spaces. Ultimately, whether you are in search of knowledge,
resources, technology, or a home, traversing a megacity is a rich, yet perilous experience. Here are the guidelines for implementing
megacity exploration into your campaign.

THREATS IN MEGACITIES
Spending extended periods in unexplored areas of alien ruins involves the risk of unseen dangers.
To represent the menaces of a stalking threat, add a tension clock. When you suffer a cost through failure, delay, or inaction, you
may advance the clock to show the threat drawing closer. The Lurking Threat table offers inspiration for these scenarios, including
what signs you may encounter as the tension clock advances and what occurs when the clock fills.
Learn more about tension clocks on page 238 of the Starforged rulebook.
MEGACITY EXPEDITION RANK
The rank of your expedition into a megacity is chiefly determined by its size and complexity. Use the results of these oracles, on
page 168, to reference the appropriate column and row on the table below.
It is important to keep in mind that other factors might also influence rank, such as the fictional circumstances and the importance
of this endeavor in your story. Modify the rank of the expedition one rank lower or higher as appropriate.

represent the average rank of any encounters. The encounter rank might be one severity lower or higher depending to the
circumstances. Adjust accordingly, keeping in mind that the maximum rank is epic.

     CEILING CITY
     A ceiling city is a residential site designed to hang from the upper interior surface of a megastructure, cave, or
     other natural formation, although it is also possible to find them on an artificial roof constructed in a planet's sky.
     The general form of the city tends to be that of a chandelier of a cluster of stalactites. Navigation between the
     structures of this marvel and the access to its interior requires a vehicle.
     CLOUD CITY
     The cloud city is a megalopolis built to hover in the air at high altitudes above the surface of a world. The city itself
     is supported by one or many islands that contain the technology necessary for suspension, which may be huge air-
     filled spheres, immense rotors, or some kind of gravitic engine. At the same time, this megacity could be tethered,
     free-floating, or movable, which makes the permanence of its location uncertain at first sight.

     MOVABLE CITY
     Also known as a walking city, this grand livable residence was designed to accommodate the need for constant
     movement. Its motility can vary, from being pulled or pushed by other vehicles if it is small enough, to propulsion,
     wheels, or legs in case they are bigger.
     SEA CITY
     The sea city is an artificial island made megalopolis. The structure could be an extension of a ground-based city,
     an isolated city far from the land, or a movable city on the surface of a body of water. Most areas of this megacity
     are underwater, like an iceberg. It is also possible that this structure exists not as a single unit, but as a group of
     linked, mobile islands.

UNDERGROUND CITY
Also known as a subterranean or pit city, this residential site was apparently built to obtain underground protection
and cover in exchange for sunlight. Key zones of the city often have support towers that hold the weight of
the surface or function as entrances to the whole structure by containing elevators or shafts which lengthen
downwards as the expansion of the megacity continues deeper underground.
UNDERWATER CITY
An underwater city is a submerged residential site composed of numerous structures that serve as the city's
zones. It is assumed that this composition was made to isolate the potential accident that might occur, so if a
zone is flooded, the other structures would not be affected. Likewise, to mitigate the pressure of the depths, these
structures become thicker as the megacity descends, and their lights are artificial in the absence of sunlight.

ENCOUNTERS WITHIN                                             THE DEPTHS
As you explore the long-lost and forgotten corners of the
galaxy where alien civilizations left their mark, you will
encounter various dangers, including constructs, bio-
mechs, and anomalies.
CONSTRUCTS
Constructs are the inevitable result of the development
of an intelligent species. The keepers-the constructs left
behind in the far corners of the galaxy by the precursors-
are the few remaining technologies we have of their
civilizations. They are as intriguing as their creators, and
we have assumed that their functions have been limited to
guarding, maintaining, and preserving the megastructures,
but we are certain there is still much to unravel.
Although it is also possible to find them in the wilds of
the planets. They tend to be particularly hostile to human
presence on precursors' sites. In addition, the intricate
system that composes them means that they can
eventually develop a consciousness of their own.
This chapter provides a set of oracles to generate human
and precursor-made constructs.
                                                              BIO-MECHS

                                                              to compliment or increase their capabilities. Orgnetics

                                   ANOMALIES
                                   Anomalies are the after-effects of reality and the laws of
                                   physics being fractured or broken. They are the residual
                                   phenomena of the many experiments the precursor
                                   civilizations performed and are seemingly caused by what
                                   explorers call splinters; rare objects formed by these
                                   inexplicable conditions that hold immense power.
                                   When encountered, most expeditioners choose to avoid
                                   anomalies, but the most daring explorers will purposefully
                                   face them or enter them to retrieve the splinter they hold
                                   at their core.
                                   There are two types of anomalies: entities and aberrations.
                                   Entities are anomalies whose effect has been concentrated
                                   into a smaller area, creating a mobile and hostile form.
                                   Aberrations are anomalies whose effects are spread across
                                   a localized area of terrain.
                                   This chapter provides a set of oracles to generate anomalies.
                                   The Anomaly Effect oracle in this chapter replaces the one

CONSTRUCTS
When the time comes for you to venture within the vast
inner spaces of a megastructure or megacities, the
majority of your encounters will be with the keepers.
However, in your adventures throughout the galaxy, it is
possible to encounter hostile constructs made by humans.
While overall less capable than the precursors' creations,
they still present a real threat.
ENCOUNTERING A CONSTRUCT
When you are forced to face a construct in a high-stakes,
action-oriented conflict and need to determine its rank,
follow these guidelines:
* Ifyouencounteraconstructoutsideamegastructure,
     roll or pick from the table below.
* If you encounter a construct within a megastructure,
     follow the Encounters Rank guideline provided in
     Chapter 5 on page 99.

Remember to envision how the environment and the nature
of your goal may impact the rank of a combat objective. If
you are outmatched, make the rank higher. If you are well-
prepared or in a position of strength, make it lower.

BIO-MECHS
Bio-mech generation uses the creature and construct
oracles. Ancient Wonders does not provide creature
oracles. By default, it references the ones in the Starforged
rulebook, on page 336, or Starforged Reference Guide, on
page 68.
In some of the Starforged oracles, you roll up to twice.
However, during this process, you only roll once on each of
those table.
ENCOUNTERING A BIO-MECH
When you encounter a bio-mech, Ask the Oracle (50/50)
if it is a cyborg; otherwise, it is an orgnetic. Then, use the
same principles stated in the Encountering a Construct
section, on page 184.
BIO-MECH GENERATION
When generating a bio-mech, follow the corresponding
steps on the next page. These oracles are not intended to
be used all at once, but as the narrative demands.
Appearance: The Environment, Scale, Motility, and First
Look oracles will flesh out the bio-mech's appearance.
Encounter: The Encountered Behavior, Purpose, and Initial
Disposition tables will frame how the encounter with the
bio-mech begins. If unsure how a bio-mech engages in
combat, Ask the Oracle (50/50) if it attacks at a distance. If
not, it attacks in close quarters.
Revelation: As you interact with a bio-mech and gain
a deeper understanding of it, use the Revealed Aspect
construct oracles to get a clearer picture of its nature or
to reveal new characteristics.
Use the Sentience oracle if the bio-mech is an orgnetic.
Given that cyborgs started their existence as living beings
of flesh and blood, they are all sentient beings.

While traveling across the desert world Helios, you
encounter a bio-mech.
First, you Ask the Oracle (50/50) if it is a cyborg. The answer
is yes.
Then, you roll on the appropriate oracles and get the
following results:
* CreatureEnvironment: Land
* CreatureScale: Medium
* CreatureForm: Snake / Eel
* ConstructMotility: Quadrupedal
* CreatureFirstLook: Distinctive sound
* ConstructFirstLook: Primitive or rudimentary
After coming up with the cyborg's appearance, you roll to
determine the details of the encounter as follows.
* EncounteredBehavior: Migratory.
It journeys across the sands, much like yourself.
Knowing that the bio-mech is aware of your presence, you
roll for its initial disposition.
* Constructinitialdisposition: Threatening.
It starts hissing menacingly. You know that a misstep could
mean a sudden attack.
You Face Danger to stay calm and still, hoping that it stops
perceiving you as a threat. On a strong hit, the attention
of the snake-like cyborg is suddenly redirected elsewhere.
Given that you are in an area where one bio-mech has been
found, you conclude that it is possible that another hybrid
was the source of the distraction. So you Ask the Oracle
(unlikely). The answer is `yes'.
You Ask the Oracle (50/50) if the other bio-mech is a cyborg.
The answer is `no'. It is an orgnetic.
192                                                              ANCIENT WONDERS

                                   You start shaping the orgnetic with the oracles that provide
                                   its appearance and get the following results:
                                   * ConstructEnvironment: Land
                                   * ConstructScale: Small
                                   * ConstructMotility: Bipedal
                                   * BasicCreatureForm: Avian / Winged
                                   * ConstructFirstLook: Multi-jointed
                                   * CreatureFirstLook: Graceful
                                   You are aware that the bird-like orgnetic distracted the
                                   cyborg, but you have not determined its disposition. You
                                   roll on the appropriate table and get the following result:
                                   * ConstructInitialDisposition: Hostile
                                   The orgnetic hurtles towards you. You Face Danger to
                                   dodge it and score a strong hit. So it refocuses its attention
                                   towards the cyborg, slamming into it and beginning a
                                   vicious fight.
                                   The orgnetic tries to subdue the cyborg, but the stability
                                   granted by the cyborg's synthetic legs is difficult to
                                   overcome. It must use some trickery to exert its control,
                                   so you decide to roll on the next oracle and get a revealed
                                   aspect for an ability.
                                   * ConstructRevealedAspect: Hidden weaponry
                                   The bird-like bio-mech reveals a weapon that begins to emit
                                   a searing beam, severing the cyborg's legs from its torso.
                                   The snake begins to panic and strikes back. "What is it going
                                   to do?", you ask. And so you roll on the Creature Aspect
                                   oracle and get this result:
                                   * RevealedCreatureAspect: Projectile attack
                                   The snake-like bio-mech does not attack using projectiles.
                                   The bio-mech itself is a projectile.
                                   The injured cyborg pounces quickly and violently toward
                                   against the orgnetic's throat before dragging it, thrashing,
                                   to the ground.
                                   Now the avian bio-mech is on the ground, striving against
                                   the cyborg's brutal force.
                                   Thank the dice you scored a strong hit with that first Face
                                   Danger move.

ANOMALIES
The magnitude of the precursors' experiments not only pushed the limits of their technology, but also seemed to push the limits
of the universe itself. Anomalies are among the most terrible horrors in the galaxy. We know so little about them that they are one
of the most powerful threats humanity might face. The implications of their strangeness and the effects of their presence make
these phenomena exotic targets for those who seek to unravel the mysteries of alien civilizations.
When including anomalies in your campaign, take into consideration how the religion, magic, and horror truths of your world
interact with these aberrations and entities.

                  SPECIAL COMPANIONS MASTERY VOW
                  Each special companion listed in this section has a mastery quest starter. This represents a lingering ambition or unrelenting
                  desire of the companions. When you acquire a special companion, make their quest starter a concrete mastery vow. By default,
                  these quests are of formidable rank, but you can make them extreme if you wish to make them more prominent or difficult in
                  your story.
                  The special companion mastery vow is linked to their master ability. Once you have ended this quest successfully, you unlock the
                  ability on the card with the stats and condition meters.
                  The mastery vow is not a prerequisite to acquiring special companion assets. Instead, it is an opportunity for special companions
                  to grow and acquire permanent, special capabilities for future missions in your campaign. The fulfillment of this vow represents
                  not only an improvement in their skills but also a stronger bond of loyalty to you.

that redefined what was possible. With an ample supply                               how they were to be handled in the field. While it's true
of these batteries, we no longer needed enormous power                               that most foundries don't give enough thought to weapon
plants within every settlement or spacecraft. Since then,                            design, some take great pride in their craft. This ensures
while once a rarity, they are now as ubiquitous as we are.                           their creations are truly special.

EXCHANGING WEALTH
The moves presented in this section expand upon what is conceptually covered in the Resupply move by incorporating wealth as
a currency.
The incorporation of wealth as a monetary resource in the Starforged system is explained on page 28 of Sundered Isles. However,
this is the necessary information for you to use this resource with only the content present in Ancient Wonders:
* You can acquire wealth with the Taking a Hiatus set of moves on page 230 or by selling an item using the Exchange Wealth
   move on page 229.
* You record wealth as ledger items. A ledger item may have a wealth value of 1 to 5. These ledger items may be a stockpile of
   trade goods, payment in the form of credits, a cache of money, a relic, or a valuable item in general.
*  Wealth is spent as a tool for narrative permission. However, it is usually not an excuse for skipping moves altogether, but to
   actually make them. For instance, with the Exchange Wealth move on page 229 you may hire a repair "average service" to make
   the Repair move "At a Facility", or you can hire a guidance "average service" to Set a Course instead of making the Undertake
   an Expedition move.

FAILING FORWARD
Facing hardships and overcoming them is a key part of any
adventure. These are keystones of your character growth.
If you would like to make failures an influential aspect of
your character progression, use the following guidelines.
You can introduce this mechanic into an ongoing campaign
or a new one.
First, create a failure track. This is a standard progress
track with ten boxes. Then, when you make an action or
progress roll and score a miss, make the following move.
MARK YOUR FAILURE
When you make a move and score a miss, you may

REWORKING YOUR                                              LEGACY
Given that Ancient Wonders incorporates special
companions and item assets within the Starforged
system, the legacy moves--except Earn Experience--have
undergone some adjustments.
ADVANCE
When you develop your abilities, improve your
resources, gain a reward, or boost your influence,
you may spend experience to add a new asset or
upgrade one. Choose from the following categories as
appropriate to your focus and opportunities.

Item                            1             1
This revision of the Advance move includes special
companions, item assets, and the possibility of upgrading
the character with the wealth resource, which inclusion in
the system is explained in the Exchanging Wealth section
of this chapter, on page 226.
An alternative to the Advance moves for character
progression is the Exchange Wealth move on page 229,
which uses the currency resource instead of experience.

CONTINUE A LEGACY
Progress Move
When you retire from your life as Ironsworn, or succumb to death or desolation, you may create a new character in your
established setting. If you do, roll the challenge dice and compare the results of the former character's legacy tracks: quests,
bonds, and discoveries (one roll per track).
For  each strong hit, choose one from below, or one from the weak hit or miss options.
*    Follow their path: Take one path or companion asset (regular or special) from the former character (at no cost), including
     any marked abilities.
*    Share a connection: Take one connection from the former character, including any accrued progress or bond benefits.
*    Accept an inheritance: Take the former character's command vehicle and one module or support vehicle, as well as an
     additional item (at no cost), including any marked abilities.
For  each weak hit, choose one from below, or one from the miss options.
*    See it through: Choose one of the former character's unfinished quests, and Swear an Iron Vow (with an automatic strong
     hit) to see it done. You may immediately mark up to half the former character's earned progress (round down) on this
     quest.
*    Rebuild a connection: Name one of the former character's connections, and envision how time or circumstances have
     changed them in a dramatic way. When you Make a Connection with them, take an automatic strong hit and mark two
     ticks on your bonds legacy track.
*    Explore familiar ground: Name a location that was meaningful to the former character. When you first visit that place,
     envision how it has changed or is endangered. Then, mark two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.
For each miss, choose one.
* Deal with the aftermath: Envision how one of your former character's foes has gained power or influence.
* Switch loyalties: Envision how you begin in opposition to your former character's beliefs, goals, or allegiances.
* Open Pandora's Box: Envision how an advancement or discovery has unleashed unexpectedly dire consequences.
This revision of the Continue a Legacy move takes into account Ancient Wonders' contributions to the system. Although
the change is minimal, the formality of this revision is the result of inclusion of special companions and item assets.
