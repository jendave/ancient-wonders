## Features and Notes

### The Wondrous Side of the Galaxy Awaits

* *Ancient Wonders* is the biggest third-party expansion for Starforged to date with great system-agnostic compatibility. It provides you with all you need to explore the galaxy in a way that has never been done before, with generators for solar systems, planets, alien megastructures, megacities, and hazardous, otherworldly encounters; all with new mechanics to deepen and twist your adventuring endeavors.
* *Ancient Wonders* is modular: each chapter is independent of each other. You can take whichever you like from the supplement as a standalone expansion. Most are system-agnostic.
* The FoundryVTT module includes roll tables and macros for the tables in the expansion.

## Module Installation

To install the module, click on `Install Module` and search for `ancient wonders` in the `Add-On Modules` tab of the Foundry VTT game setup screen. Then click on `Install`.

Or use this URL and click on `Install`:

```bash
https://github.com/jendave/ancient-wonders/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

### Install Rolltables

Open the `Ancient Wonders Oracles` compendium and copy the folders to the `Rollable Tables` tab.

### Install Macros

Macros for the expansion can be found in the `Ancient Wonders Macros` compendium. Drag and drop any you need into the macro toolbar. Macros use the current `Roll Mode` when executed.

### Ironsworn/Starforged Tip - Use Custom Folders to add Character Sheet Oracles

* Use this method to add the Ancient Wonders kit.
* If it does not already exist, create a `Custom Oracles` folder in `Rollable Tables` tab called:
  * `Custom Oracles` - EN
  * `Oráculos personalizados` - ES
  * `Oracles personnalisés` - FR
  * `Własne Wyrocznie` - PL
  * `Свои оракулы` - RU

Open the `Ancient Wonders Rolltables` compendium and copy the folders into the `Rollable Tables` `Custom Oracles` folder.

![Rollable Tables - Ancient Wonders Oracles](https://github.com/jendave/ancient-wonders/blob/main/docs/ancient-wonders-oracles-rollable-tables.jpg?raw=true)

The Oracles will be available in the Character sheet under `Custom Oracles`.
